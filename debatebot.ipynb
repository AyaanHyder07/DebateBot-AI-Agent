    "# DebateBot: The Autonomous Fact-Checking Debate System\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏆 Agents Intensive Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Overview**\n",
    "**DebateBot** is a multi-agent AI system designed to conduct autonomous, high-level debates while performing real-time fact-checking. Unlike standard chatbots, this system uses a **Multi-Agent Architecture** where distinct agents (`ProAgent` and `ConAgent`) actively research, reason, and rebut each other, orchestrated by a `Moderator` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features**\n",
    "* **🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Three distinct agents collaborating (Pro, Con, & Fact-Checker).\n",
    "* **🧠 ReAct Logic:** Agents use a \"Thought -> Action -> Observation\" loop to reason before speaking.\n",
    "* **🔎 Tool Use:** Integrated `Google Search` tool allows agents to ground arguments in real-world data.\n",
    "* **✅ Agent Evals:** Includes a custom evaluation pipeline to prove fact-checking accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Run**\n",
    "1.  Ensure your **Google AI Studio API Key** is added to the \"Secrets\" add-on as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.\n",
    "2.  Run the **Setup & Installation** cells below.\n",
    "3.  Run the **Debate Loop** to watch the agents argue live!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎤 Run the Debate\n",
    "By default, this runs a pre-selected topic so the notebook generates a full output log for the judges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Want to try it yourself?**\n",
    "Uncomment the `input()` lines in the code below to type your own topic interactively!"
